## Overview
The purpose of Upload API release version 2.6.1 is to introduce a new configuration YML file for defining manifest groups and mapping them to one or more delivery targets.  This configuration was proviously defined in the JSON files within the upload-config
subproject of this repository.  Now, those JSON file are only responsible for defining schema for manifest validation.  All configuration for upload delivery has been moved to `upload-server/configs/phdo/deliver.yml`.  The overall purpose of this change is
to make it easier to configure delivery targets for a given data stream and route.

In addition, several bug fixes and code cleanups were performed.

## Enhancements
- Introduction of the deliver.yml file for delivery configuration
## Bugfixes
- Fix for info endpoint returning null for delivery names for failed deliveries
- Fix for info endpoint timestamps to use nanosecond precision
- Fix for delivery date folder partitioning to use the `dex_ingest_timestamp`
## Cleanup
