# CDC Data Exchange (DEX) Upload
 
The CDC Data Exchange (DEX) Upload API is an open-source service created to support public health data providers in their effort to share critical public health information with internal CDC Programs. The open-source model allows users to tailor the tool to fit specific data needs. <br/>

The Upload API service is a highly scalable, highly reliable means of transiting files of nearly any type and size from public health partners to the CDC, even when sent over unreliable network connections.

## Upload Services

**Resumable Uploads**: Implementation of the Tus service as a library in a Golang application, facilitating high volume file uploads over HTTP. 

**Authentication**: OAuth provider approval enforcement to ensure security.

**Metadata Verification**: Enforcement of upload submission metadata standards.

**File Delivery**: Routing of uploaded files to configured target destinations.

**File Observability**: Upload lifecycle event tracking, open telemetry traces and metrics, and endpoints for health check, information, and application version. 

**Retry Delivery**: Tool that delivers files to target destinations that uploaded successfully, but were unsuccessful in delivery.

**User Interface**: Facilitates uploads and observability within a user interface.

## Repository Contents

### .github

Utilized for test and CI/CD automation (`/workflows`).

### docs

Release Notes (`/Release Notes`), OAS3 API Documentation, and other relevant documentation.

### reupload-tool-go

Retry functionality that delivers files to target destinations that have uploaded successfully, but were unsuccessful in delivery.
- [Delivery Retry README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/reupload-tool-go/README.md)

### tests

Smoke test suites leveraging kotlin (`/smoke/kotlin`) and playwright (`/smoke/playwright`).
- [Kotlin Smoke Test README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/tests/smoke/kotlin/README.md)
- [Playwright Smoke Test README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/tests/smoke/playwright/README.md)

Load testing tool enabling high volumes of file uploads (`/bad-uploader`).
- [Load Testing Tool README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/tests/bad-uploader/readme.md)

### upload-configs

Configuration files containing manifest schema values and routing delivery details for specific data stream use cases. JSON configuration files are utilized to verify metadata accommpanying uploads and to determine file delivery to specified target locations.
- [Upload Configs README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/upload-configs/README.md)

### upload-reports

Go application that fetches data from the [Processing Status GraphQL API](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-processing-status), generates a CSV report, and optionally uploads it to S3.
- [Upload Reports README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/upload-reports/README.md)

### upload-scripts

Go script that connects to Azure storage, lists blobs within a specific container, and deletes them.
- [Upload Scripts README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/upload-scripts/README.md)

### upload-server

Upload server functionality leveraging Tus v2 capabilities written in Golang. Capabilities include resumable file uploads, metadata verification, event routing, observability endpoints, file delivery, distributed file locking, OAuth token verification, user interface, unit testing, and integration testing.
- [Upload Server README](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-upload/blob/main/upload-server/readme.md)

## TUS Protocol

This repository is using the TUS resumable upload protocol: [https://tus.io/](https://tus.io/), and reference implementation: [https://github.com/tus/tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd)

## Example Usage

Example clients, for back-end or browser (front-end), to upload files: [https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-api-examples](https://github.com/CDCgov/data-exchange-api-examples)

## Future Improvements

- Upload routing configuration defined within the upload server; removes JSON configuration file dependency
