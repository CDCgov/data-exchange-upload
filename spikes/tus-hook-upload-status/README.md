TUS itself doesn’t have a built-in mechanism to directly detect whether a file upload has been paused or abandoned. It primarily deals with managing the upload process itself, such as resuming interrupted uploads and handling errors gracefully.

To detect if a file upload has been paused or abandoned, we might need to implement custom logic on top of TUS. 

Here’s a general approach you could take:

1. Track Upload Progress: Keep track of the progress of each file upload. This could involve storing metadata about the upload (e.g., upload status, bytes transferred, etc.) in a database or some other persistent storage.

2. Detect Paused Uploads: Implement logic to detect when an upload has been paused. We can do this by monitoring the time elapsed since the last data transfer or by comparing the current progress with the previous progress at regular intervals. If there’s no progress for a significant period, we can consider the upload as paused.

3. Detect Abandoned Uploads: Similar to detecting paused uploads, we can also detect when an upload has been abandoned by setting a threshold for inactivity. If there’s no progress for an extended period beyond what’s considered reasonable, we can assume the upload has been abandoned.

4. Trigger Alerts: Once you detect that an upload has been paused or abandoned, we can trigger alerts or notifications as needed. This could involve sending notifications to users, logging the event for analysis, or taking other appropriate actions based on app's requirements.
